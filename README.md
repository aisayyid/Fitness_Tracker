  User can add workouts by clicking the "new workout button."  They are then prompted to fill out the fields, and they can keep adding as many exercises as they'd like.  Once they are done, they can press the "complete" button, which will take them back to the home page, and their last workout will be appended.  If the user would like to continue tracking those same workouts, they would click the "continue workout button and make sure to type in the same workout.
